Introduction:
This Sudoku game was started as a personal project to bring us back on track with web development after spending months traveling and not using a computer all this time. We thought We forgot most, but it seems getting back to business took less time thanWe thought, and was also fun process. 
We wanted to build a Sudoku game in pure JS, after playing lots of Sudoku on our iPhone. At the beginning the game was simple, We managed to create a board with random numbers which followed the rules of the game: 
1.	No number can repeat itself in the same 3x3 square
2.	No number can repeat itself on the same 9 cells column or row.
3.	Every empty cell should have a "mirror" empty cell (for example cells [0,7] & [8,1] OR [3,3] & [5,5]) ps. when Cells and 3x3 Cox index starts from '0' ,left to right, top to bottom.
4.	Each game should have one and only solution to be considered a valid Sudoku game.

Features:
Reset and Undo options are available to "Reset" the whole game and to "Undo" the last move in the game.
